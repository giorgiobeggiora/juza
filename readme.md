# Juza Cloud Manager

Juza is a desktop application that lets you merge the space available from multiple cloud storage services into virtual local folders.

It requires that the sync client of each cloud storage service you want to use runs locally too.

Juza manage and distribute the content of the local folders to best fit the remote storage limit of each remote storage service.

Made with Electron.
